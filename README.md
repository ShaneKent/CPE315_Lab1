Shane Kent likes poopy butts.

When running the compiler use this:
gcc -Wall -Werror -ansi -pedantic Lab1_1.c

-Wall and -Werror make it so that all of the warnings are displayed during compilation and that all of the warnings are treated as errors so that you are FORCED to fix them before compiling. This is a great practice.
